# ShopifyToFirebaseSync
This is a server side code to sync Shopify customers with a Firebase Database

This is designed to make it seamelessly sync orders between shopify and firebase database. 

You will need Node.js for this to run correctly

Here's an example that demonstrates how to achieve the synchronization using a custom Shopify app and Firebase Realtime Database:

1. Create a Custom Shopify App:
   - Create a new Shopify app in your Shopify Partner account.
   - Configure the necessary app details, including the app name, app URL, and permissions required to access customer orders.
   - Generate API credentials (API key and API secret) for your Shopify app.

2. Set up Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project if you haven't already.
   - Enable the Firebase Realtime Database in your project.
   - Note down your Firebase project credentials.

3. Implement Shopify OAuth Authentication:
   - Set up an authentication flow in your Shopify app to obtain an access token for the authorized shop.
   - Store the access token securely for later use in API calls.

4. Build an Integration Script:
   - Use a server-side language of your choice (e.g., Node.js, Python) to develop an integration script that fetches customer orders from Shopify and stores them in the Firebase Realtime Database.
   - Authenticate your Shopify API requests using the shop's access token obtained during the OAuth process.
   - Connect to your Firebase project using the Firebase SDK for your chosen server-side language.
   - Push the retrieved customer order data to the Firebase Realtime Database.

5. Configure Webhooks:
   - Set up a webhook in your Shopify app to receive order-related events (e.g., when a new order is created or updated).
   - Configure the webhook URL to point to your integration script endpoint.
   - Ensure your integration script handles webhook notifications and updates the Firebase Realtime Database accordingly.

6. Deploy and Test:
   - Deploy your integration script and webhook endpoint to a server or cloud platform capable of running server-side code.
   - Test the synchronization by placing new orders in your Shopify store and verifying that they appear in the Firebase Realtime Database.

Remember to handle authentication, error handling, and data updates securely in your integration script. Also, make sure to implement proper error logging and monitoring to ensure smooth synchronization between Shopify and Firebase.
